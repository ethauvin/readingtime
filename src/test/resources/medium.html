            Eons ago, a couple of Medium engineers got fed up. They were sick of having to scroll all the way down the
            page to see how long a story was. It was wearing out their trackpad, it was making their fingers sore, and
            they figured there must be a better way. So they sat down and devised a simple formula, and the Medium read
            time was born.</p>

                adoption of this feature across the internet, we decided to shed some light on exactly what goes in to
                our read time calculation.</p>
            <blockquote class="ly"><p id="13d1" class="lz ma bj hw b mb mc md me mf mg ld bn">Read time is based on the
                average reading speed of an adult (roughly 275 WPM). We take the total word count of a post and
                translate it into minutes. Then, we add 12 seconds for each inline image. <strong class="ay">Boom, read
                    time.</strong></p></blockquote>
            <p id="17fc" class="kq kr bj ks b ip mh ku is mi kw kx mj ix kz mk ja lb ml jd ld gx ct">Lately, we have
                seen more and more long form stories containing a ton of images. With our release of <a
                        href="https://medium.com/the-story/introducing-image-grids-c592e5bc16d8"
                        class="cg dj mm mn mo mp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">image grids</a>, we expect even more of
                these types of essays.</p>
            <p id="c072" class="kq kr bj ks b ip kt ku is kv kw kx ky ix kz la ja lb lc jd ld gx ct">Our original read
                time calculation was geared toward “slow” images, like comics, where you would really want to sit down
                and invest in the image. This resulted in articles with crazy big read times. For instance, this <a
                        href="https://medium.com/@dahul/inside-medium-94931f66eebd" class="cg dj mm mn mo mp"
                        target="_blank" rel="noopener">article</a> containing 140 images was clocking in at a whopping
                87 minute read. So we amended our read time calculation to count 12 seconds for the first image, 11 for
                the second, and minus an additional second for each subsequent image. Any images after the tenth image
                are counted at three seconds.</p>
            <p id="fbc9" class="kq kr bj ks b ip kt ku is kv kw kx ky ix kz la ja lb lc jd ld gx ct">You might see this
                change reflected across the site. Keep in mind that our estimated read time is just that: <em
                        class="mq">an estimation</em>. You might finish a story faster or slower depending on various
                factors such as how many children or cats you have, your caffeine/alcohol intake, or if you’re a
                time-traveler from the future and already read that story. We just want to give you a ballpark figure so
                you can decide whether you have time to read one more story before the bus comes, or if you should
                bookmark it for later.</p>
            <p id="369b" class="kq kr bj ks b ip kt ku is kv kw kx ky ix kz la ja lb lc jd ld gx ct">We aren’t done with
                read time yet. In the future, we’d like to tailor it to your reading speed, account for the <a

                        class="cg dj mm mn mo mp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">complexity of an article</a>, and add
                support for other languages. We’ll be sure to let you know about these changes as they happen.</p></div>
